# Setup

This information is intended for first-time setup instructions. If you have worked on a similar project before, you may already have some of this installed.

You will need to run the following commands.

```bash
$ bower install
# => once installed check by trying `bower -v`
```

This should add a 'bower_components' directory to your project.

If the bower installation fails, you may need to edit your git config. Use the following line:

```bash
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://
```
